# Lecture 03 - Exercise 02
#
# This is a debugging exercise: you're given working code
# with an error in it. Your task is to find and fix the error.
#
# `sum_of_array` is the entry point to this code (line 37).
# Set a breakpoint there, step through the program,
# verify that the correct data is fetched from memory.
#
# The function should calculate the sum of the first 5 elements
# of the array stored at address 0x20018000.
# Variables `array_address` and `n_words` define those constants.
# The result should be stored into `sum_result`.
#
# Before you start: 
# Start simserver and choose Server->IO Setup
# For "Serial Communication Interface 1", choose "06 Console".
# If you let the program run fully (press F5), the test
# result will be printed to console.
#
# Note: see an Introduction to Debugging on Canvas if you
#       do not know how to start.
